# Scorm tool API

Scorm tool API project is a simple API for working with SCORM files. Currently only files generated by Rise Articulate are supported.

## Technologies

The project is written in TypeScript, using Prisma as an ORM for database connectivity and management. Nodemon is used in development mode to monitor for file changes.

## Installation

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies, then either `npm start` to run in production mode, or `npm run dev` to start in development mode.

Development mode uses nodemon to monitor for file changes.

## Initial setup

Database connection string should be stored in an environment variable (can use `.env` file) called `DATABASE_URL` [read documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases/connect-your-database-typescript-postgres). Can (probably) use `npm prisma migrate dev` to [generate database and update using migration scripts](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/command-reference#migrate-dev).

## Usage

Run with the included `Dockerfile`.

Build with:

```bash
docker build . -t scorm-tool-api
```

Run with

```bash
docker run -p 3001:3001 --name scorm-tool-api scorm-tool-api
```

It's an API, you make calls to the endpoints. No, there's currently no mapping of the endpoints, I'll add that to the TODO list...

## Notes

Currently on V1, so no authentication is used. V2 will include token based authentication sent with requests.

### Database Updates

1. Edit the schema in `prisma/schema.prisma` and save the file
2. Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name <some meaningful name>` to save and apply the migration
